DATA VISUALIZATION TASK				
Create a MONTHLY dashboard for 2019 using charts and/or tables to illustrate the dynamic of the following metrics:

- Sessions split by acquisition source				
- Total page views				
- Average page views per visit				
- Average bounce rate				
- Average visit duration per platform				
- Any other metric you find relevant (not compulsory)				
				
All above metrics should be shown in monthly dynamic and with change in % [Dec 2019 vs Nov 2019] and [Dec 2019 vs Dec 2018]				
				
The final dashboard should be readable as a one-page A4 printout				
				
You are free to use any tool of your choice (Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau, etc) and combine charts and tables as you wish				
The objective is to give the reader an easy-to-grasp overview of 2019 metric dynamic
